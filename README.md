# Random Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Random Number Guessing Game! This is a simple React application where you can try to guess a randomly generated number.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: When you open the game, a random number between 1 and 20 is generated.
2. **Make a Guess**: Enter your guess into the input field provided. Your guess must be a number between 1 and 20.
3. **Submit Your Guess**: Click on the "Submit Guess" button to submit your guess.
4. **Guessing Feedback**: After submitting your guess, you'll receive feedback indicating whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. **Keep Guessing**: You have 5 chances to guess the correct number. Keep guessing until you get it right!
6. **Play Again**: Once the game is over (either you've guessed the number correctly or used all your chances), you can click the "Play again" button to start a new game.
